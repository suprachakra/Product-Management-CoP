# Product-Management-CoP

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

The **Product Management Community of Practice (CoP)** is a strategic initiative designed to enhance collaboration, streamline product management practices, and deliver measurable business impact in a large, complex organization. Operating across multiple Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and business domains, the CoP aligns with SAFe principles to produce actionable, sprint-ready resources, foster cross-functional collaboration, and establish a centralized knowledge hub.

The CoP integrates into the organization’s delivery framework to improve prioritization, dependency management, and stakeholder alignment, ensuring consistency across global markets and divisions. This scalable initiative supports enterprise goals, such as improving time-to-market, increasing operational efficiency, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.
