### **6.2 Iteration-Ready Templates**  
---

### **Introduction: Why Iteration-Ready Templates in a CoP?**  

Iteration-ready templates developed within the Community of Practice (CoP) tackle inefficiencies in scaled Agile environments by providing standardized, reusable tools. These templates solve critical problems in backlog prioritization, dependency tracking, and risk management by ensuring:

1. **Alignment with SAFe Principles**:
   - Templates operationalize key SAFe practices like WSJF, ROAM, and dependency management.  

2. **Standardization Across ARTs**:
   - CoP-developed templates ensure consistent adoption and alignment across teams and ARTs, reducing duplication and improving efficiency.  

3. **Scalability and Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Templates evolve through collaborative feedback, scaling proven practices across the organization.

4. **Time-to-Market Acceleration**:
   - Pre-configured tools minimize operational overhead, allowing teams to focus on delivery.  

---

#### **6.2.1 WSJF Backlog Prioritization Template**

---

### **1. Context and Use Case**

#### **Problem Statement**  
Backlog prioritization often suffers from:
- Subjectivity and inconsistency across teams.  
- Misalignment with business objectives.  
- Delayed delivery of high-value items.  

#### **Why a CoP Is Ideal**  
The CoP collaboratively develops and refines the **WSJF Backlog Prioritization Template**, ensuring:
- Standardization of WSJF scoring across ARTs.  
- Automation and integration into JIRA workflows.  
- Continuous improvement through retrospective feedback.

#### **Use Case**  
During PI Planning, a team manages 100+ backlog items. Using the WSJF template, they calculate priority scores for each item, ensuring alignment with PI Objectives and faster delivery.

### **2. Key Features**

| **Feature**                  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated WSJF Scoring**    | Auto-calculated WSJF scores based on Business Value, Time Criticality, Risk Reduction, and Job Size. |
| **Real-Time Dashboards**      | Dynamic ranking of backlog items to prioritize work effectively.                                |
| **Leadership Visibility**     | Dashboards show how WSJF priorities align with PI Objectives and Portfolio Epics.               |
| **ROAM Integration**          | Links WSJF scoring with ROAM risks to prioritize high-impact mitigation tasks.                  |

---

### **3. Solution Design**

#### **3.1 Workflow for JIRA Integration**
1. **Fields Setup**:
   - **Business Value (BV)**: Impact score (1‚Äì10).  
   - **Time Criticality (TC)**: Urgency score (1‚Äì10).  
   - **Risk Reduction (RR)**: Mitigation value (1‚Äì10).  
   - **Job Size (JS)**: Effort score (1‚Äì10).  
   - **WSJF Score**: Auto-calculated as (BV + TC + RR) √∑ JS.

2. **Automation Rules**:
   - **Trigger**: Updates to any WSJF input field.  
   - **Action**: Recalculate WSJF scores and reorder the backlog dynamically.  

3. **Leadership Dashboards in Confluence**:
   - Show top WSJF-prioritized items and their impact on delivery goals.

---

### **4. Next Steps**
1. Finalize WSJF template configurations in JIRA, including automation workflows.  
2. Conduct workshops with pilot ARTs to train teams and gather feedback.  
3. Monitor adoption metrics like prioritization speed and business value delivered.  
4. Publish the finalized template in the CoP repository with detailed documentation.

#### **6.2.2 Dependency Mapping Playbook**

---

### **1. Context and Use Case**

#### **Problem Statement**  
Unresolved dependencies create bottlenecks, misaligned timelines, and delivery delays, particularly in scaled Agile environments.

#### **Why a CoP Is Ideal**  
The CoP collaboratively develops the **Dependency Mapping Playbook** to:
- Standardize dependency tracking and escalation.  
- Integrate best practices across ARTs for scalability.  
- Leverage visual tools like Miro for clarity and collaboration.

#### **Use Case**  
During PI Planning, Team A identifies dependencies with Team B and a vendor. Using the playbook, they log, assign ownership, and track progress in JIRA while visualizing connections in Miro.

| **Cross-Team Visualization**   | Miro maps highlight inter-team and external dependencies, color-coded by status.                |
| **Leadership Metrics Dashboard**| Tracks unresolved dependencies and their impact on PI milestones and timelines.                |

---

### **3. Solution Design**

#### **3.1 Workflow for Dependency Management**
1. **Document in JIRA**:
   - Fields: Dependency Name, Owning Team, Blocking Team, Priority, Resolution Plan, Status.  
2. **Visualize in Miro**:
   - Nodes represent teams; arrows represent dependencies.  
   - Color-coded (e.g., red = blocked, green = resolved).  

3. **Automation Rules**:
   - **Trigger**: Dependency overdue for 5+ days.  
   - **Action**: Escalate to RTE and notify stakeholders.  

---

### **4. Next Steps**
1. Configure JIRA for dependency tracking and integrate visualizations via Miro.  
2. Pilot the playbook with one ART to refine workflows and gather feedback.  
3. Scale adoption across ARTs, ensuring cross-ART escalations are automated.  
4. Publish the final playbook in the CoP repository with documentation and visual guides.

#### **6.2.3 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Template**

---

### **1. Context and Use Case**

#### **Problem Statement**  
Reactive risk management leads to escalated issues, delivery delays, and reduced predictability.

#### **Why a CoP Is Ideal**  
The CoP creates a **Risk Assessment and Mitigation Template** to:
- Standardize risk management using SAFe‚Äôs ROAM framework.  
- Integrate proactive risk identification and tracking.  
- Ensure continuous learning through shared mitigation strategies.

#### **Use Case**  
During PI Planning, Team B identifies risks involving system integration delays. The template helps log risks, assign ownership, and track mitigation actions in JIRA.
