# 1. Executive Summary

The **Product Management Community of Practice (CoP)** is a strategic initiative, fully endorsed by executive leadership, designed to enhance collaboration, streamline product management practices, and deliver measurable business impact in a large, complex organization.

Operating across multiple Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and business domains, the CoP aligns with SAFe principles to produce actionable, sprint-ready resources, foster cross-functional collaboration, and establish a centralized knowledge hub.

**Key Highlights**  
- Integrates with the organizationâ€™s delivery framework to improve prioritization, dependency management, and stakeholder alignment.  
- Ensures consistency across global markets and divisions.  
- A scalable initiative supporting enterprise goals such as time-to-market, operational efficiency, and continuous learning.  
- Includes a comprehensive change management plan to ensure smooth adoption at all levels.

> **Why Now?**  
> Failure to address these challenges could result in ~20% increase in project delays and a significant decline in customer satisfaction within a year. By implementing the CoP proactively, we position ourselves ahead of competitors and safeguard our market share.
