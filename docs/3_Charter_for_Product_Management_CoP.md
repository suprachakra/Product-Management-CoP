| üå± **Scalability**           | **Phase 1**: Pilot with 2 ARTs (70% participation, 60% deliverable adoption)<br/>**Phase 2**: Expand to more ARTs (80% adoption, confirm resource readiness)<br/>**Phase 3**: Enterprise-wide rollout with tailored adaptations.                             |
| üíπ **Engagement & ROI**      | - 10% improvement in time-to-market<br/>- 15% fewer dependency delays<br/>- Implement robust change management, track leadership support (75% min. attendance in key CoP meetings)                                                                        |
