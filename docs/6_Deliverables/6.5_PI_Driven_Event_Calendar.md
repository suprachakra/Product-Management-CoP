# 6.5 PI-Driven Event Calendar

## Purpose
Align CoP activities with SAFe PI cycles, ensuring repeated, structured engagement that drives tangible business outcomes.

## Core Objectives
- **Strategic Integration**: Tie CoP events to PI milestones (Planning, Reviews, Retros, System Demos)
- **Scalable Planning**: 3-quarter detailed calendar with a 5-quarter projection
- **Actionable Insights**: Each event yields deliverables (dependency maps, risk dashboards, or improvement plans)
- **Continuous Engagement**: Gamification + leadership involvement each PI
- **Measurable Impact**: Track KPI improvements per event
