# 6.2 Iteration-Ready Templates

## Introduction: Why Iteration-Ready Templates?

In a scaled Agile environment, **standardized, reusable templates** address key challenges in:

1. **Backlog prioritization**  
2. **Dependency management**  
3. **Risk assessment**

Developed within the CoP, these templates:

- **Operationalize SAFe principles** (like WSJF, ROAM)
- **Standardize** processes across multiple ARTs
- **Scale** through collaborative feedback loops
- **Accelerate time-to-market** by reducing overhead

## 6.2.1 WSJF Backlog Prioritization Template

**Context & Use Case**  
- Problem: Subjectivity and inconsistency in backlog prioritization.  
- CoP Value: Shared WSJF scoring approach, integrated into JIRA.

**Key Features**  
- Automated WSJF scoring fields in JIRA (BV, TC, RR, JS)  
- Real-time dashboards  
- Leadership visibility  
- ROAM integration

**Solution Design**  
1. **Fields Setup**  
   - Business Value (1-10)  
   - Time Criticality (1-10)  
   - Risk Reduction (1-10)  
   - Job Size (1-10)  
   - **WSJF** = (BV + TC + RR) / JS

2. **Automation Rules**  
   - Trigger: Field update  
   - Action: Reorder backlog by WSJF

**Next Steps**  
- Finalize template configs in JIRA  
- Conduct workshops with pilot ARTs  
- Publish final template in CoP repository

## 6.2.2 Dependency Mapping Playbook

**Context & Use Case**  
- Problem: Unresolved dependencies cause bottlenecks.  
- CoP Value: A standard approach to identifying, tracking, and visualizing dependencies.

**Key Features**  
- **Dependency Tracker** in JIRA (ownership, timelines)  
- Automated alerts for overdue dependencies  
- Miro-based cross-team visualization  
- Leadership dashboard (unresolved dependencies & timeline impact)

**Solution Design**  
1. **Document in JIRA**  
   - Fields: Dependency Name, Owning Team, Blocking Team, Priority, Resolution Plan, Status  
2. **Visualize in Miro**  
   - Color-coded connections between teams  
3. **Automation**  
   - Overdue dependencies escalate to RTE

**Next Steps**  
- Configure JIRA for dependency tracking  
- Integrate Miro boards for cross-team visualization  
- Scale across ARTs once pilot is successful

## 6.2.3 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Template

**Context & Use Case**  
- Problem: Reactive risk management leads to escalated issues.  
- CoP Value: Standardizing the ROAM (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated) framework.

**Key Features**  
- ROAM classification in JIRA  
- Cascading risk tracking (root vs. dependent risks)  
- Automated alerts  
- Leadership dashboard for high-priority risks

**Solution Design**  
1. **JIRA Setup**  
   - Risk Score (Likelihood x Impact)  
   - Mitigation plan & status  
2. **Cascading Risks**  
   - Link root risks to child risks
3. **Automation**  
   - Overdue risk escalations  

**Next Steps**  
- Finalize JIRA workflows  
- Pilot with one ART  
- Aggregate lessons & publish in CoP repository
