- **Tutorials** for JIRA, Miro, Confluence
- **Case Studies** showcasing real-world success
- **Best Practices** aligned with SAFe
- **Archived Content** for older versions
- **FAQs** for troubleshooting

## JIRA Dashboards: Integration
1. **Repository Usage**  
   - Bar graphs for resource access frequency  
2. **WSJF Adoption**  
   - Pie chart for template usage rate  
3. **Dependency Mapping**  
   - Line chart for resolution speed  
4. **Risk Management**  
   - Progress tracker for open vs. resolved risks

## Implementation Plan
1. **Platform Selection**: Confluence as primary, embedded JIRA dashboards  
2. **Repository Structure**: Core resources, trending resources, archived content  
3. **Advanced Search**: Implement robust filters (by ART, resource type, priority)  
4. **Governance & Maintenance**: Quarterly content reviews by ART-level curators  
5. **Content Population**: Start with core templates, then add tutorials and success stories

## Engagement and Adoption
- **Workshops and Gamification** to encourage usage
- **Challenges**: e.g. “Most Innovative Template”  
- **Leaderboards**: highlight top contributors

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk                    | Impact                           | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Low Engagement          | Underutilized repository         | Gamification, highlight success stories in CoP meetings  |
| Outdated Resources      | Misaligned team practices        | Automate version control, quarterly reviews             |
| Inefficient Search      | Time wasted finding resources    | Advanced filters, robust search index                   |
| Governance Bottlenecks  | Delayed content updates          | Distribute oversight among ART-level curators           |

## Next Steps
- Finalize structure & JIRA dashboard configs
- Populate with core resources and real-world case studies
- Launch workshop to train teams
- Monitor usage metrics, refine workflows
