# 2. Use Case Context

## 2.1 Organization Overview
- **Scale**: Global operations with multiple divisions, each running its own ARTs.
- **Complexity**: High interdependencies across teams, business units, and external vendors.

## 2.2 Challenges
1. Misaligned prioritization processes across ARTs leading to inefficiencies.
2. Dependency bottlenecks impacting delivery timelines.
3. Limited cross-functional collaboration due to silos.
4. **Change resistance**: Teams experience change fatigue due to numerous initiatives, leading to skepticism about new processes.

## 2.3 Strategic Goals
- **Improve global alignment** in product delivery.
- **Reduce dependency-related delays** by 15% in the next 6 months.
- **Establish a centralized repository** for reusable product management resources.
- **Secure unified executive sponsorship** across divisions for resource allocation and adoption.
- **Initiate vendor collaboration**: Begin discussions with key vendors during Phase 2 to assess integration needs, aiming for full collaboration by Phase 3.
