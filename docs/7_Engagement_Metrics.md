# 7. Engagement Metrics

## 7.1 Key Metrics
- **Participation Rate**: % of CoP members attending events & completing activities
- **Deliverable Adoption Rate**: % of CoP outputs adopted by ARTs
- **Repository Growth**: # of new resources (templates, playbooks) per quarter
- **Cross-Team Dependency Resolution**: % of multi-ART dependencies resolved
- **Leadership Impact Metrics**: CoP contributions to business KPIs (time-to-market, cost savings)

## 7.2 Dashboard Features
- **Role-Based Views**: Summaries for leadership vs. detailed team views
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Graphs for participation trends, deliverable adoption, repository contributions
- **Gamification Elements**: Leaderboards, badges, and live feed of “top contributors”
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Slack or email notifications for unresolved dependencies, overdue risk items

## 7.3 Implementation Plan
1. **Tool Integration**: JIRA + Confluence + Slack/Teams
2. **Data Pipelines**: Automated scripts to gather metrics nightly
3. **Feedback Automation**: Post-event surveys feed automatically into dashboards

## 7.4 Sample Dashboard Layout
| Section                | Visualization                                        | Purpose                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Participation Trends   | Line graph (attendance per event over time)         | Monitor engagement & spot dips early               |
| Deliverable Adoption   | Bar chart (teams vs. adoption rates)                | Evaluate how effectively CoP outputs are utilized  |
| Repository Contributions | Heatmap (contributions by team/category)          | Identify active contributors & content gaps        |
| Dependency Resolution  | Stacked bar (resolved vs. unresolved dependencies)  | Track cross-ART collaboration health               |
| Risk Management        | Progress tracker (open vs. resolved risks)          | Focus leadership attention on critical risks       |

## 7.5 Risks and Mitigations
| Risk                  | Impact                             | Mitigation Strategy                                       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Accuracy Issues  | Misleading insights                | Automate validation checks, regular data audits          |
| Dashboard Complexity  | Overwhelms users                   | Provide simplified role-based views, training sessions    |
| Low Engagement        | Limited dashboard adoption         | Gamify usage, highlight top improvements                 |

## 7.6 Use Cases
1. **Identifying Low Participation**: Use line graphs to see which ARTs missed multiple events.
2. **Low Deliverable Adoption**: Spot teams who are not using new templates or playbooks.
3. **High Unresolved Dependencies**: Auto-escalate critical dependencies that remain open past due dates.

## 7.7 Visual Enhancements
- **Gantt Charts** for rollout schedules  
- **Swim Lanes** for each ART’s engagement progress  
- **Color Coding** to highlight urgent risks or dependencies
